        <h2>Thoughts</h2>
        <h3>The problem with the modern world</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Every facet of the economy has been liberalized as though it must be made as efficient as possible, with no slack, because to do so is 'a waste' </li>
          <li>Everyone has been told they must do more with less resources again this time around </li>
          <li>Everything gets planned as though there is no slack for any interruptions, because that would e.g. present an uncompetitive budget in which to invest </li>
          <li>Every institution is like this </li>
          <li>Everyone's employment â€” and thus their capacity to put food on their table â€” is tenuous and will have more career changes over their lifetime than ever before, meaning everyone has to keep pleasing their institution's demands </li>
          <li>Every kid has figured out that having a problem that is unexpected to anyone in any institution that they deal with causes stress â€” and that this stress sits in the background all through solving the problem, and is often the biggest concern of the person helping the kid with the problem, not the problem itself </li>
          <li>Every kid starts thinking their entire presence is a source of stress unless they're essentially perfect and never need to ask anyone for help          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Another problem with the modern world</h3>
        <q>Modern man thinks he loses somethingâ€”timeâ€”when he does not do things quickly. Yet he does not know what to do with the time he gainsâ€”except kill it.</q>
